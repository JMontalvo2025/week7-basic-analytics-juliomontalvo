This week's OGL focused on comparing Python coding with Excel functions and Pivot Tables to achieve equivalent business analytics results.  
Each assigned task was successfully implemented in both Python and Excel, and results were cross-verified to ensure consistency.

## 📊 Insights
- The West region had the highest average profit, followed closely by East in second place, and, not too far behind, was South in third. However, Central was behind those regions.
- Around 80% of the orders showed High Performance (positive profit).
- Nearly 80% of orders were classified under the Low Profit Tier (≤ $500), and almost 20% showed a Loss(< $0). Very few orders reached the Medium or High Profit Tiers.
- Technology had the highest total sales per category, while Furniture and Office Supplies had similar sales levels.
- Standard Class was the most commonly used shipping mode.

## 💡 Python vs Excel
- Python is more efficient for logical operations and automation. Even without deep coding knowledge, generating visualizations can be simpler than in Excel.
- Excel remains a powerful tool for data exploration and visualization, but it requires more manual effort.

## ✅ How to Use
Run the notebook top to bottom. Open the Excel file to compare.
